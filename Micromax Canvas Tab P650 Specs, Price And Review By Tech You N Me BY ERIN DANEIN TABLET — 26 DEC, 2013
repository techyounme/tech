Design and Build

The build is quiet similar to Micromax Canvas top end smart phone doodle2 the front is covered by broad bezel around the screen the screen is glossy hence there is a fingerprints on the screen which looks quiet hazy and requires a constant cleaning also spotted on the front side is a 2MP camera and a earpiece at the centre top of the tab.

Coming to the back which has a brushed aluminum finish resulting in a very good look and is also better to hold on but the back panel is irremovable also spotted at the rear is the 5MP autofocus camera at the top left corner and the speaker grill the Micromax logo along with the model name is embedded at the centre of back panel. The tablet is thin at 10mm and hence is quiet comfortable to hold though it is little heavier due to the presence of aluminum back panel making it difficult to use by one hand.

Coming to the side panel one thing that is missing is the power button which is surprisingly located at the top of the tab while the volume button is located at the right and while the left hand side is bare there is 3.5mm audio jack and Micro-USB port sitting at the top of the Canvas Tab.
